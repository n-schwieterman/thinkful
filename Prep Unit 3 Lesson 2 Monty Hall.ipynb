    "At the start, the car has an equal chance to be behind each door, 1/3, so you have a 1/3 chance to choose the car out of the gate. Once you pick, there is a 1/2 chance that Monty will pick either remaining door, but there is also a 0% chance that the door that Monty will reveal has the car behind it.  If the car is behind either of the remaining doors(most likely), Monty only has one choice, or a 100% probability to choose the other remaining door. The probability of your door containing the car is still 1/3, but the probability of the other door containing it becomes 2/3."
